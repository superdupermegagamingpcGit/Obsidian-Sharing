This is your new *vault*.

Make a note of something, [[create a link]], or try [the Importer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer)!

When you're ready, delete this note and make the vault your own.

- Obsidian uses a coding language/typesetting language of Markdown. So there are a couple of interesting ways to write titles big, insert pictures, etc.
- The main draw of Obsidian is making this **graph view** on the right, this lets you link documents with other ones.
- The idea being eventually you have a kind of *brain* in your Obsidian. 
- Below is a link of how to get started on Obsidian, its a lot. But really you can just mess around and findout:

#### Important note

I have also installed Obsidian on your laptop. Now, Obsidian doesn't have a free way to share files, but you CAN use something like OneDrive, emails, Google Cloud, OR **Github**.

I'd recommend the last, it will be the nicest to use, and the coolest.

Here is a link to your GitHub that I setup on your Google Account: 

https://github.com/superdupermegagamingpcGit/Obsidian-Sharing

And on it, is an explanation of how to go about doing the file sharing.

I have changed your theme to Pink Topaz, that's easily changed to something else. Unfortunately no Miffy theme, I checked.

Testing. (Delete this line)
