# Obsidian-Sharing
A shared folder, to merge your Laptop and superdupermegagamingPC files/notes.

### How to use

Interestingly, this "READme" file, uses Markdown too, just like Obsidian, so hashtags do titles, etc.

Now, this should be fairly easy to figure out. Here are the preliminary steps:

1. Obsidian has a "Vault" on your desktop, this is just a local files folder. This Repository (names of folders or projects on GitHub), also does this.
2. Once you're finished with your session, go to GitHub, go to **add** and click **upload files**
3. Then just simply upload the work you did, really you want to do all of them. Put them as a new commit.
4. Go to your other computer, and just download the **most recent** files, to your computer. Delete the old ones first though, otherwise you will have copies.
5. Voila!
