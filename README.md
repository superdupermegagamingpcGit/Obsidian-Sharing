# Obsidian-Sharing
A shared folder, to merge your Laptop and superdupermegagamingPC files/notes.

### How to use

Interestingly, this "READme" file, uses Markdown too, just like Obsidian, so hashtags do titles, etc.

Now, this should be fairly easy to figure out. Here are the preliminary steps:

1. Obsidian has a "Vault" on your desktop, this is just a local files folder. This Repository (names of folders or projects on GitHub), also does this. So I've put the Obsidian vault **inside** the GitHub local repository.
