# Obsidian-Sharing
A shared folder, to merge your Laptop and superdupermegagamingPC files/notes.

### How to use

Interestingly, this "READme" file, uses Markdown too, just like Obsidian, so hashtags do titles, etc.

Now, this should be fairly easy to figure out. Here are the preliminary steps:

1. Obsidian has a "Vault" on your desktop, this is just a local files folder. This Repository (names of folders or projects on GitHub), also does this.
2. Once you're finished with your session, go to GitHub, go to **add** and click **upload files**
3. Then just simply upload the work you did, really you want to do all of them. Put them as a new commit. As long as the file names didn't change, it should overwrite previous files with new notes.
4. Go to your other computer, and just download the **most recent** files, to your computer. Delete the old ones first though, otherwise you will have copies.
5. Voila!

The appeal is, if you cock up, you can go back to old **commits**(this is what putting something ONTO GitHub is called). The action of uploading and downloading on GitHub is reffered to as **pushing** and **pulling**.

Happy note-taking!
